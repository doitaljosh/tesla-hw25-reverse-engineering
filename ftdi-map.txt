HW2.5 FTDI serial port map

Port 0 <---> No output (maybe a debug console for LB?)
Port 1 <---> Tegra B serial console
Port 2 <---> Tegra A serial console
Port 3 <---> Lots of binary data (Ublox GPS receiver?)

The serial debug console connects to UARTB on both Tegra SoCs, 
and only outputs bootloader logs. As soon at the Linux kernel 
executes, there is no output. After looking at the device tree, 
it's evident that Tesla disables UARTB on production firmware.
Hard-wiring to the SPI flash and patching the DTB on an unfused
board will allow you to re-enable UARTB.
